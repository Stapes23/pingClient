# Your ping client program should sends 10 ping requests to the server. After sending
#each request client waits up to one second for reply from the server. If no reply is received
#during this time period, client times out. In this case you should print out the time out message.
#Specifically, your client program should do the following:
#(1)Print out the current time and the ping attempt number. Send the ping message using UDP.
#(2) Print the response message from server, if any (the server will capitalize the message sent
#by the client and send it back to the client). Print out the elapsed time in microseconds.
#(3) Calculate and print the round trip time (RTT), in microseconds, of each packet, if server
#responses.(4) Otherwise, print “Request timed out
